  <h1>PERSONAL NARRATIVE</h1> 

    <h2>INTENTION</h2>
       <p> My intention when designing the site was to showcase my traditional and digital photography. I really wanted to emphasize my photos, so I kept the website structure simplistic and used neutral colors to make the photos the main focus of the pages. I also provided a short bio and contact information for people to contact me and get a feel for what type of photographer I am.</p>
    <h2>CONTENT AND STRUCTURE</h2>
       <p> For my content, I really wanted to focus on my traditional and digital photography. In order to do so, I took photos of my traditional photo prints with an ipone 4. I realize that scanning the images would have displayed the image with better quality, however, I do not have a scanner available at schoool. I uploaded digital photos from my camera, and placed all photographs into my final portfolio project folder. In my about me page, I also included two pictures of myself, as well as a doodle I drew. I did not inclue titles or explantions for my photographs for I wanted the viewer to create their own opinions of each photograph. For the structure, I wanted to keep the website simple and easy to navigate. Therefore, I used a side menu on the left to navigate, and created a table that would display all of my pictures horizontally by scrolling. I made the pictures the largest pieces of content on the page, again, to put the focus on the images. </p>
    <h2>DESIGN & PRESENTATION</h2> 
        <p> As I mentioned above, I wanted to keep the layout and design simple. I looked at other photgraphy sites for inspiration and ideas, and I really liked the design that photographer Tom Hoops chose. I page sourced his website, and figured out how to apply some of his java script to my own page. After viewing all of the photography sites, I noticed that they all acquired a simple asthetic. I used a black background to make my images, espeially the digital photos, contrast from the background. I then used a simple nav bar that was light grey and see through as the pictures scrolled through. I also implemented icons for Facebook and Twitter at the bottom of the page for viewers to connect to me. I kept the full menu available for all pages, and kept the same fonts, colors, headings, and background color for each page. </p>
    <h2>APPLICATION OF COURSE MATERIALS</h2> 
        <p><strong>BOOTSTRAP:</strong> For my navigation bar, I used the menu section in bootsrap to implement the option of nav-stacked that was listed in the components section. I made the menu options become highlighted in white when a user scrolls down the menu. I also used bootstrap to implement Javascript. I copied the javascript from Tom Hoops website since that is how I was looking to get my pictures to be displayed. The Javascript was the only part of the code that I was unsure what to do with, so I left as is.</p> 
        
        <p><strong>TOM HOOPS WEBSITE:</strong> After I page sourced the code from his website, I completely changed every aspect of it and spent a lot of time doing it. I changed the background of the website, the position length, width, and height of the menu. I changed the font style and headings, and implemented an additional heading (h2) for each page that appears on the menu when clicked on. I basically used his website for inspiration, and went through every aspect of his code, changing it and turning it into the website I envisioned. I page sourced his website and basically used it as a starter template because I wanted to get the code for the javascript to display the images in the same style he did. Therefore, I really had to go through the code using skills we learned in class such as using margins and padding to really make the website how I wanted it to look. I learned a lot from doing this, because I really had to dig into the code and do research online to understand what elements in the code were implementing certain styles. I really enjoyed doing this! </p>
        
        <p><strong>FONT-AWESOME:</strong> I used font awesome to implement my Twitter and Facebook Icons. Since we did this previously in another assignment, it was not too difficult for me to place on my menu. I made them smaller, and at the bottom of the page, so they wouldn't be too prominent. I used Icons instead of text because I figured it would be easier for viewers to notice a symbol before reading text. </p>
